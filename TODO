11:03 <+osfameron> t0m: OK, I'm going to try to integrate CX::SimpleLogin -- I've set myself an arbitrary 1 hour goal to do it :-)
11:04 <+osfameron> (I'm sure it'll only take 5 mins, but I can be a bit dumb at reading and grokking docs ;-)
11:04 <@t0m> osfameron: good luck! :) The docs aren't yet awseome.. Please be yelling as/when it's not obvious :)
11:05 <+osfameron> t0m: and you'll say "patches welcome"? ;-P
11:05 <@t0m> osfameron: Heh, well, I may actually be writing some of them if you can point out where it's needed as it's my personal crap ;_)
11:25 <+osfameron> t0m: do I have to Does('NeedsLogin') ?  I'm already doing :RequiresRole(user)
11:26 <@t0m> osfameron: yes.
11:27 <+osfameron> ok, actually that simplifies the 3 lines of Does(ACL) RequiresRole(user) ACLDetachTo(/login) that I've got now to 1 line
11:27 <+osfameron> so win
11:27 <+osfameron> t0m: I don't see where to put the actual logic of logging in though?
11:28 <@t0m> osfameron: erm, you don't need to. That's all supplied by CX::SimpleLogin::Controller::Login
11:28 <+osfameron> t0m: um... how does it know?
11:31 <+osfameron> gosh, lots of deps
11:31 <+osfameron> I thought I'd have most of them having ActionRole and Auth roles and all
11:33 <@t0m> osfameron: Yeah, sorry, it should maybe have been called Task::BeLike::t0m ;)
11:34 <+osfameron> is it going to expect to do authentication differently, or will it plug into 'Authentication' that I already have setup ?
11:34 <+osfameron> wow, Crypt::DH tests are slow...
11:34 <+osfameron> could you remove the deps on the crypto stuff then?
11:34 <+osfameron> as that stuff takes ages to install/test and is fragile.
11:34 <+osfameron> *cough* Angerwhale
11:35 <@t0m> osfameron: Yes, well, kinda.. I can at least make OpenID optional, and do something about making sure you have the right crypt things to not be horribly slow..
11:36 <+osfameron> ooo! search.cpan.org knows where your repository is
11:36  * osfameron logs into the bug tracker of doom
11:42 <+osfameron> logged
11:42 <+osfameron> in fact that crypto dep is still running
11:42  * osfameron grumbles
11:43 <+osfameron> ah.  strace says: waitpid(8526, 
11:43 <+osfameron> piece of crap
11:43 <+osfameron> (Crypt::DH)-- # broken test
11:44 <+osfameron> for fuck's sake
11:44 <+osfameron> the test is called: t/07-openid-live.t
11:45 <+osfameron> it's actually failing doing a fucking LIVE test?
11:45 <+osfameron> (Crypt::DH)-- ' 
11:45 <+osfameron> I'm in a fucking library, the port is probably blocked or something
11:45 <+osfameron> that sounds sensible
11:46 <+osfameron> thanks
11:50 < ijw> osfameron: Bloody live tests in modules have been winding me up for weeks.
11:51 <+osfameron> well, 'notest' as Caelum suggested works fine
11:52 <+osfameron> I'd rather run the other (non-live) tests though
11:54 <+osfameron> ah
11:54 <+osfameron> or to have M::I create honour something like: make installdeps --notests  ?
11:55 <+osfameron> yarr
11:57 <+osfameron> t0m: ::Form::Login could usefully document what the standard fields are?  (i.e. if you already have those then no need to configure further?)
12:00 <+osfameron> t0m: do I need to 'use' ::ActionRole::NeedsLogin to get it ?
12:00 <+osfameron> the docs don't have a use line, so I don't know if it's automagically folded in?
12:00 <+osfameron> ooo, Chained++ # only have 1 place in each controller that I need the Does(NeedsLogin) part
12:01 <@t0m> osfameron: no, as long as your controller @ISA controller::ActionRole, then Does(NeedsLogin) will take care of loading the class for you
12:01 <+osfameron> oki
12:02 <+osfameron> hmm, Can't locate object method "login_redirect" at ::NeedsLogin line 14
12:02 <+osfameron> I think I have WithRedirect in the traits
12:03 <+osfameron> ah no, hadn't saved Web.pm
12:04 <+osfameron> shiny: I get the login form, I log in.
12:04 <+osfameron> Then I have Couldn't go("")
12:04 <+osfameron> eeek!  the form must've told it to redirect somewhere silly
12:06 <+osfameron> ah
12:06 <+osfameron> if you're on /login
12:06 <+osfameron> then after you login, you stay there
12:07 <+osfameron> hmm, does NeedsLogin work with Chained?
12:09 <+osfameron> I've added :Does(NeedsLogin) to various places, but it only seems to be honouring it for the index :Path :Args(0) one
12:09 <+osfameron> not for the chained ones
12:12 <+osfameron> t0m: or is that something I'm doing rong?
12:14 <+osfameron> oki, no worries.  I'll come back to it later myself
12:16 <@t0m> osfameron++ # Thanks, that was really helpful - I'll document / add tests for everything you've been confused/unsure about tonight :)
12:36 <+osfameron> t0m: no worries, I'll have another look when you've had time to update those.  And let me know about :Chained stuff! ;-)
12:36 <+osfameron> thanks for the module, I think it'll be shiny now that I'm beginning to get a picture of it

LLLAAAAAMMMMEEEEE:
'Controller::Login' => {
         login_form_class_roles => [ 'CatalystX::SimpleLogin::Form::LoginOpenID']
    },

18:29 < stephan48> code: http://pastebin.com/f2f2d7024 log: http://pastebin.com/f2a456d1
18:32 <@t0m> stephan48: so what's the actual issue?
18:32 <@t0m> You hit a page, get redirected to /login
18:32 <@t0m> you login, then it redirects you to your code
18:32 <@t0m> which explodes.
18:33 <@t0m> erm, I'm confused a bit, actually. As there isn't actually a hit where you login
18:33 <@t0m> It just shows you the login page..
18:39 < stephan48> t0m, yea but hit after redirect /profile/update should also redirect to login
18:39 < stephan48> because user is not logged in....
18:40 < stephan48> so /profile/show works like it should(redirect) but /profile/update doesnt work (no redirecz)
18:40 <@t0m> ah, right :) I get it :)
18:40 <@t0m> yeah, that's a bug :)
18:47 < stephan48> t0m, as far as i see it needs we atleast need a controller and actionrole :)
18:47 < stephan48> same with chained code
18:47 <@t0m> stephan48: http://github.com/bobtfish/catalystx-simplelogin/blob/master/t/lib/TestAppRedirect/Controller/Root.pm
18:47 < c0bra> t0m: and so I have my __PACKAGE__->config call wrapped in an if-check on __PACKAGE__->debug
18:47 <@t0m> c0bra: yes, please nopaste the code.
18:47 <@t0m> And when I say 'the code', I mean your MyApp.pm class.
18:47 < c0bra> sure
18:48 < stephan48> t0m, i already copied that ;)
18:48 <@t0m> stephan48: Yes, you don't need to.
18:48 <@t0m> stephan48: Just add tests there..
